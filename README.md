# 🥁 Java Drum Management GUI

This project is a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** application developed using Java Swing as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming (CST8132)** course at 
**Algonquin College**. The application simulates the management and testing of various types of drums, including flammable and toxic drums, using polymorphism and 
inheritance principles. It also includes a custom `DrumPanel` for the GUI display.

## 📁 Project Structure


- `Drum.java`: This is an abstract class which has three variables which provides a base bluprint. 
- `FlammableDrum.java`: This is a class which extends abstract class Drum and represents a type of drum that contains flammable materials. 
- `ToxicDrum.java`: This is a class that extends abstract class Drum and represents a type of drum that contains toxic materials.
- `Drum_Test.java`: This is a class which tests types of drums.
- `DrumPanel.java`: This class serves as the main panel/container object for the application GUI widgets.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java** (OpenJDK 21.0.4 LTS)
- **Swing** (Java GUI Framework)
- **OOP Concepts**: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation
- **Eclipse IDE** or any Java-compatible IDE

---

## 🚀 Features

- Launches a responsive GUI window with custom layout and controls.
- Differentiates drum behavior based on type (flammable or toxic).
- Uses **Swing** look-and-feel customizations (Metal & Ocean themes).
- Encapsulates clean class design and modular architecture.
- Applies GUI event handling through Java Swing.

## 🧪 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository** or download the ZIP.
2. Open the project in your IDE (e.g., Eclipse).
3. Navigate to the `Drum_Test.java` file in the `test` package.
4. Compile and run the file. The GUI window should launch.

## 💡 Fun Fact

This project was my introduction to building **graphical applications in Java** and taught me how to apply object-oriented logic visually!
